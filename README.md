# Line-Detection-Using-Hough-Transform
The Hough Transform is a method that is used in image processing to detect any shape, if that shape can be represented in mathematical form. It can detect the shape even if it is broken or distorted a little bit. 
A line can be represented as y = mx + c or in parametric form, as r = xcosθ + ysinθ where r is the perpendicular distance from origin to the line, and θ is the angle formed by this perpendicular line and horizontal axis measured in counter-clockwise-geeksforgeeks
